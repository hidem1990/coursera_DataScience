# coursera_DataScience
This is my project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" assignment on Coursera.
run_analysis.R is my codebook.
## 1st; I downloaded the file and unzipped it.
## 2nd; I read the files in R environment from my local directory.
## 3rd; I merged training and test data into one dataset. And also I rename column here.
## 4th; I remove columns of the same name for extraction.
## 5th; I extracted the subject, activity, colunm including "mean" or "std".
## 6th; I added the colum for descriptive activity.
## 7th; I group by subject and then by activity. I summarized means of each column by grouping previously.
