# coursera_DataScience
This is my project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" assignment on Coursera.
run_analysis.R is my codebook.
1st; I downloaded the file and unzipped it.
2nd; I read the files in R environment from my local directory.
3rd; I merged training and test data into one dataset. And also I rename column here.
4th; I remove columns of the same name for extraction.
5th; I extracted the subject, activity, colunm including "mean" or "std".
6th; I added the colum for descriptive activity.
7th; I group by subject and then by activity. I summarized means of each column by grouping previously.
